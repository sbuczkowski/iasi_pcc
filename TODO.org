* netcdf changes to be made
** group nesting
*** iasi_pcc_to_netcdf
    - remove loop over bands (line 76ff)??
    - change nccreate(..., '/Evecs/Band/pcscores', ...) to something
      more along lines of nccreate(..., '/pcscores_bandN', ...)
*** iasi_pcc_from_netcdf
    - lines 35-42 changes commenserate to iasi_pcc_to_netcdf
    - change ncread(..., '/Evecs/Band/pcscores', ...) to ncread(...,
      '/pcscores_bandN', ...) to match iasi_pcc_to_netcdf
*** iasi_pcc_uncompress_granule
    - lines 36-43: same treatment as iasi_pcc_from_netcdf
    - does this routine /really/ need to exist??

** compression
*** pack/scale/offset of non-pca data
    - need to encode scale and offset attributes for each datafield as we store it

*** pack/scale/offset of eigen data
   Will require restructuring the netcdf write/read so, we should just
   bite the bullet and do this in conjunction with the group nesting
   changes above.
   - For band1: 1: int32, 2-42: int16, rest: int8
   - For band2:  1-2: int32  3-63: int16  rest: int8
   - For band3: 1: int32  2:45: int16  rest: int8

** General refactor
   - in general, this code feels a bit cluttered. What can we do to make it easier to follow?

** documentation
   - Build out README.org
